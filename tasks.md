## Binary Upload Boom

## Things to do/help:
- dashboard.ejs has a form to submit comments, so we'll need a route for '/addComment' to handle a POST request
  - help with how to link the comment to the correct photo? (is there a way to add a listener that grabs the photo's unique id? Should this be a PUT request instead?)

## ejs files
- index.ejs (done -- paths: '/auth/login', '/signup', '/profile')
- login.ejs (Deiticus)
- signup.ejs (Deiticus)
- feed.ejs ()
- posts.ejs ()
- dashboard.ejs (dvkr)

## database (mongodb - brownfox)

## azure auth connectivity (brownfox)
